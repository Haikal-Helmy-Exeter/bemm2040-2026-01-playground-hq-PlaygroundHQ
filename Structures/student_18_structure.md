TYPE: FRAME
SIZE: 4x4
COLOR: PURPLE
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]
The code can be interpreted that there are 4 blocks laid horizontally, with 2 identical pillars of 2 blocks at its ends, set vertically downwards. 
This is followed by another row of 4 horizontal blocks under the 2 block pillars.

The numbers 4x4 would mean that the overall shape is to be 4 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall. 

"Colour" signals that purple LEGO blocks are to be used. 


## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]
It is simply a set of instructions to build a 4x4 square, with a gap in the middle, out of purple LEGO blocks. 



## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]
A square frame with a hole in the middle.



## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?]
The depth of the frame, how many blocks deep is it supposed to be built with.
